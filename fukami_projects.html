            <p>In this pair-programming project my partner and I took an existing tutorial from MIT App Inventor and refined it, improving the game stylistically and interface-wise. The changes that we added into the game itself was a score system, multiple choice answers, and refining the game to make it flow easier. Stylistically we added more questions that would appeal to the newer generations, flashy text, home and finishing screens, and changing the overall layout to make it all fit on one screen without scrolling. From this project I learned many important skills for the coding industry. I learned about documenting all the individual versions of the game. Whenever we completed a big task, we would save it as a version of the game and then continue with our next task. If the new task fails, we can always just restart with the saved version. Along with that, while pair programming we couldn’t work on it at the same time. To compensate for this we would have individual test versions that we would work on by ourselves and then once it was complete we would add it to the main version. This required a high level of communication in order to be the most time efficient.</p>

          <p>The Scratch Project was my first coding/engineering project and it taught me a lot about coding and how it works. It was a good intro into learning coding languages. The Scratch interface gave my partner and I the necessary blocks and allowed us to truly learn how coding works. In coding, nothing is done for you. Meaning if you want some functions to work, you must build each individual part of it. Along with that, it taught me the patience necessary and that even if a set of code works, it may not be perfect. There is almost always a better way to do something. Coding consists of a lot of trial and error. In this project my partner and I created a maze game where the player would try to make it to the finish line while dodging obstacles and choosing the right path to the finish line.</p>

            <h4>Game Theory Project</h4>
            <h6>Prisoner's Dilema</h6>
            <p>Prisoner’s Dilemma is a game involving at least two teams. The idea is that prisoners are being separately questioned and are either gonna rat the other player out (betray), or lie and keep it a secret (collude).  For every round, each team must decide whether they will collude or betray. Both colluding will result in 0 points. You betraying while they collude means you gain 100 points. Them betraying but you colluding results in -500 points. And finally, both betraying results in -250 points. This game is played for a number of rounds and at the end, the team with the highest score wins. My partner and I investigated the code that was running the game and it shows that the scores are calculated at the end. Essentially what we did was change our history according to what our opponents had inputted before. Although we did not win, we did relatively well and our code was a success. Through this project, I learned more about interacting using GItHub as well as team skills like collaboration and patience.</p>

          <h4>Escape Room</h4>
          <h6>Escape from CATS-UH-WIZ</h6>
          <p>In this game, my partner and I created a Python escape room. This featured a series of puzzles and riddles eventually, and hopefully leading to the player’s escape. This project was fun as we got to use our creativity and essentially create anything we wanted within python’s capabilities. Because the code featured a series of different riddles and puzzles, both partners could code at the same time on the same document without interfering with each other. It is always helpful to work with a partner because they can help when you are stuck and both try to do better than the other which results in a better code overall at the end. Our code/game got a lot of good feedback from players in our class. If I were given a chance to develop the game further, I would add more levels and try to make the player even more immersed within the game.</p>
