          <h5>Taekwondo-12 Years</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Since the age of four I have done Taekwondo competitively. Through it, I have learned life skills such as respect, honesty, patience, and many leadership skills. I have won many national championships and have competed internationally. Through competition I have learned to act in high pressured situations. I also teach and coach Taekwondo and it has allowed me to gain leadership skills and I have learned the most effective ways to communicate a message to all types of audiences.</li>
              </ul>
          <h5>Dublin High/Fallon Middle School Marching Band</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>I was in Band from 5th grade to 9th grade as a part of the Fallon Middle School concert and Jazz band, as well as the Dublin High School Irish Guard. In 7th grade, I was the concert band trumpet section leader and in 8th grade, I was the Jazz band trumpet section leader. In 9th grade, along with the Irish Guard I went and performed at Carnegie Hall in New York. From band I learned team-working skills. We had to be able to work together to collectively play a piece. Everyone had their own part and had to perform it perfectly. In individual instrument sections we also had to be able to coorperate to make sure that everybody was getting equal play time.</li>
