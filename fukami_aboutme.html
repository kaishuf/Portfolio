       <p>The world is advancing all around us and now, no matter what job somebody takes, technology is a part of it. My dream job is to start my own company, and in doing so computer science is very important. I am currently taking a computer science course at Dublin High School in order to know the basics of coding and technology in general. Along with this I am working on my own clothing company in order to get experience in the industry. I decided that I wanted to become an entrepreneur when I read a quote online saying that instead of working for someobody else and helping them achieve their dream, I should work for myself and do exactly what I want to do.</p>
       <br>
       <p>An entrepreneur is a leader. The person must be able to lead a group of people and ensure that their message and vision has been transfered to everyone else involved. In order to become that person, I have taken many leadership roles, especially with Taekwondo. At my taekwondo studio, I am currently teaching people of all ages, ranging from as little as three years old all the way to grown adults. Being an instructor has taught me many important skills. I now know the different types of personalities that people have and how to address or help each one. I can lead a big group and make it just as efficient as if I was only working with one student. I have also become aware and better at responding correctly and quickly when something unepected happens. All of these are very important skills whens leading a company.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Apart from teaching, I have been competing at a high level in Taekwondo. This has required me to improve my time management and multitasking techniques. The courses I have chose to take in high school also are all in order to benefit my future career. I have taken several art courses so that I have creative skills in design processes of my company. I have advanced in math and science to improve my problem solving skills and to help the business side of my company. I also have signed up to take a business course and am currently taking a computer science class.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Hopefully in the near future, I will be able to become an entrepeneur as a full-time job. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this.
